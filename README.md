# Typing Speed Test

A simple typing game that will test your typing skill measuring accuracy and words per minute.
This React project utitilized a custom hook called [react-typing-game-hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typing-game-hook) that
handles the game logic to easily create the functionality. Implemented [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) to generate random words and 
[Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) for player to player interactivity with a global chat window.
